## Overview

[Web Start](https://github.com/metrofx/webstart) is a simplified fork of [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/), an opinionated boilerplate for web development. 

## Quickstart

Clone this repository and build on what is included in the `src` directory. 

There is one HTML starting point (index.html), with no layout, but still includes minimal mobile best-practices.
If you have existing site to copy here, read the example before to make sure you can build successfully.

## Commands

- `gulp`: build `src` directory into `dist`.
- `gulp serve`: serve from `src` for development purpose. You'll spend your time here.
- `gulp serve:dist`: serve from `dist` to preview final site.
- `gulp deploy`: read credentials from `./secrets.json` then rsync to your server.
- `gulp clean`: cleanup `dist` and `tmp` directory (useful to rebuild from scratch).
