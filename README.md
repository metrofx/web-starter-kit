## Overview

[Web Start](https://github.com/metrofx/webstart) is a simplified fork of [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/), an opinionated boilerplate for web development. 

## Quickstart

Clone this repository and build on what is included in the `src` directory.

There is one HTML starting point, with no layout, but still includes minimal mobile best-practices.
